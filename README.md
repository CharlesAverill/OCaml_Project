# Friendly OCaml Template

Just run `setup.sh` to set up a ready-for-development OCaml environment

## Warning
Project description and synopsis should not include single quotes

## Docs note
Once you modify `docs/PROJECT_NAME.mld` to contain multiple sections, the `up - PROJECT_NAME` navigation at the top of the index page will disappear, and a navigation sidebar will replace it
